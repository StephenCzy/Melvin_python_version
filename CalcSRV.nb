This is a simplified version of a code that we have used in PRL 116, 090405 (2016).

The program finds experimental implementations of maximally entangled high-dimensional multi-partite states. More detailed, we use the characterization of the states according to Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 030501 (2013) - which are called Schmidt-Rank-Vector states.

The structure of the code is as follows. It contains two Mathematica-input cells.
The first cell defines all relevant functions, such as the symbolic definitions of all optical elements, the calculations of the Schmidt-Rank-Vector of an imput state, etc.

The second cell is the actual search algorithm. It creates a large number of random experimental configurations, which are executed (in a parallelized way), the output state is calculated and the property of the state is analysed. We start with an initial state that we can easily create in the laboratory (two pairs of photons, which are each three-dimensionally entangled in the orbital-angular momentum DoF). One of the photons will be used as a trigger for the other the other three photons. If the remaining three-photon state fulfills our criteria (maximally entangled, SRV state, higher-order creations from SPDC do not modify the state), then it is reported in a text-file.

For some simple examples of the symbolic transformations of the states, please see SimpleHOMExample.nb.

This code does not contain the simplification of the experiments (which can be done by applying in sequence one of several simplification rules until the Experiment does not change anymore), and it does not contain the simple learning algorithm (which added successful trials - i.e. setups that produce states which fulfill our criteria - to the list of available Actions).
